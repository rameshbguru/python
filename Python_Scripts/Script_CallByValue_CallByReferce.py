#Diff b/w call by value and call by reference
#Call by value : In the event of passing an arguments like numbers, strings and tuples to a function, the passing is like a "call by value" because we can't change the value of immutable objects being passed to the function.
#Call by reference : passing mutable objects to the function can be considered as a call by reference because their values can be changed the inside the function.
